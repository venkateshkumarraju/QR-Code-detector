# QR Code Detector with OpenCV
This project implements a QR Code Detector and Decoder using OpenCV, allowing you to detect and decode QR codes from images.
## Project Aim
The main goal of this project is to detect and decode QR codes from an image. The project guides you through reading an image, detecting the QR code, drawing a bounding box around it, printing the decoded text, and saving the result.

## Features
Image Processing: Read and preprocess images.
QR Code Detection: Detect and decode QR codes using OpenCV's built-in functions.
Visualization: Draw bounding boxes around detected QR codes and display the decoded information.
Result Saving: Save the processed image with the detected QR code.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
Matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install opencv-python-headless matplotlib
```
How to Use
Step 1: Place your input image containing a QR code in the working directory.
Step 2: Run the notebook . The QR code will be detected, and the decoded text will be displayed.
Step 3: The processed image, with the detected QR code highlighted, will be saved for further use.
